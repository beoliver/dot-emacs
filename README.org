* Emacs Config

Yet another online config

** What is it?

An emacs config inspired in no small part by this [[https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs][project]].

Assuming that you normally start emacs from an =init.el= file located in =~/.emacs.d=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

$ git clone git@github.com:beoliver/dot-emacs.git
# make a copy of your existing init.el file
$ mv ~/.emacs.d/init.el ~/.emacs.d/init-old.el

$ cp dot-emacs/init.el dot-emacs/init.org ~/.emacs.d
# if you have `custom-set-<name>` code in your existing init.el file
# then you should create a new file called `custom.el`
$ touch ~/.emacs.d/custom.el
# and then just copy that code into this new file.
# this will preserve your custom settings, and any updates will we written to this file

#+END_SRC
