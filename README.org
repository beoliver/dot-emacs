* Emacs Config

Yet another online config

** What is it?

An emacs config inspired in no small part by this [[https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs][project]].

** How to use it?

This is a config that I using. As it is under version controll I have changed the structure slightly.

Assuming that you normally start emacs from an =init.el= file located in =~/.emacs.d=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

$ git clone git@github.com:beoliver/dot-emacs.git
$ mv ~/.emacs.d dot-emacs/user
$ mv dot-emacs ~/.emacs.d

# if you have `custom-set-<name>` code in your existing init.el file
# then you should create a new file called `custom.el`
$ touch ~/.emacs.d/custom.el
# and then just copy that code into this new file.
# this will preserve your custom settings, and any updates will we written to this file

#+END_SRC

The =user= directory that you create has been set to be the =user-emacs-directory=. This means that we can simply ignore version control when it comes to that directory.
